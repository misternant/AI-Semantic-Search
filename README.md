# AI-Semantic-Search

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
 

General Overview:

The aim of this project is to implement a semantic search using artificial intelligence. You will develop a search engine that encodes the user's query into a vector and searches for similarity within a body of text. The user can store all the text to be searched using a vector database like Pinecone. This search engine will be designed to provide accurate and relevant search results.

 

Required Components:

Vector Database: You will need to choose a vector database like Pinecone to store the text that will be searched. The vector database will be used to store and index the text documents.
Vectorization Algorithm: You will need to implement a vectorization algorithm that encodes the text documents into a vector representation. You can use Open AIâ€™s latest text embeddings to vectorize the search query and the text documents to be searched from.
Similarity Search Algorithm: You will need to implement a similarity search algorithm that can find the most similar documents to the user's query. The algorithm should be optimized for speed and accuracy.
User Interface: You will need to develop a user interface that allows users to enter their queries and view the search results. The interface should be intuitive and easy to use.

Optional Components:

Multi-lingual Support: The search engine could support multiple languages, allowing users to search for documents in different languages.
Synonym Expansion: The search engine could include a synonym expansion feature that expands the user's query to include similar words and phrases.
Document Ranking: The search engine could rank the search results based on their relevance to the user's query.
Entity Extraction: The search engine could include an entity extraction feature that identifies and extracts entities like people, places, and organizations from the search results.
Customizable Search Index: The search engine could allow users to choose what text they want to be searched from and create a customized search index.
Integration with Third-Party Services: The search engine could be integrated with third-party services like Google Drive or Dropbox to provide a more comprehensive search experience.
